# Draconic-Reactor-Emulator-and-Controllor
Yet another emulator and controllor for draconic reactor in draconic evolution mod for minecraft. 

----------------------------------------------

After days of babysitting my draconic reactor, I realize that there's no way to keep the efficiency of my reactor and enjoy the game at the same time without a computer running a reliable controllor program. I searched for related tops on the internet, but the results were either too old to work properly with the latest version or just runable but having strange behavors (maybe I did something wrong, but I couldn't tell because they were not well documented), so I decided to make my own one. Because I am not familiar with the LUA programmign language, I will first disign and validate the logic stuff in Python and then migrate the controllor to LUA somehow. The project is still in an early stage and I will keep work on it in my spare time.
